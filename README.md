# Alpha OS Wallpapers
Default wallpapers for Alpha OS

## Wallpaper guidelines

We're looking for wallpapers with bold color, engaging scenery or elements, and strong composition.  Photographs are strongly prefered, but exceptions can be made for superior digital media.  CC0 is an absolute must for all wallpapers.  Submissions with any other license will be rejected out of hand.

Alpha OS runs the Pantheon desktop environment, so please be aware of Pantheon's design when making submissions.  Submissions shouldn't be overly busy so as to reduce visual conflicts with Plank, Wingpanel, and desktop icons.  Low-contrast submissions are preferred.  

Further guidelines are:

 * No text, regardless of size.
 * No logos.
 * No closeups of people or animals.
 * People are OK to include if they are facing away or otherwise unidentifiable.
 * An absolute minimum of compression artifacts, noise, and other visual distortions.
 * 1920x1080 file dimensions at the least.

## To submit a wallpaper:

 * Make sure that your submission is CC0 and from the original artist.
 * Fork the project and add your submission to the submissions folder.
 * Add artist's name, a link to their original work, and license info to submissions/next-release-wallpapers.md.
 * Add all pertinent artist exif metadata using either the exiftool command, or your chosen method.
 * Create a pull request.

All submissions will be evaluated throughout release periods, and final selections will be made to accompany Alpha OS' next release.
